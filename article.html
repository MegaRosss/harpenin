        <h2>Why should I attend events?</h2>
        <img src="./articleImg/articleImg1.png" alt="first article image">
        
            <p>HERE ARE THE 5 UNTOLD REASONS WHY PEOPLE SHOULD ATTEND EVENTS </p>

            <p> Some people - event hosts spend alot of time and resources planning life-changing events, but sometimes alot of people do not know why they should even attend these events (leaving out other factors). In turn, events receive less turnouts than they should because most of their audience do not see the need to be present at events.</p>
            
            <p>Despite everything that happens on social media and people thinking it replaced events, it has rather promoted it. Since people actually want to connect more on the basis of shared interests.</p>
            
            
            <p>Let‚Äôs look at why we @Harpenin, think people should attend events.</p>
            
            Let's dive right in! 
            
            <p>1. Networking- There are few things one can do alone, but when we make the right connection with right people. We get to advance in every sphere. 
            It's a great way to make new friends, meet potential partners and maybe find love (e choke abi üåö). There are many different channels in building a network but one of the most effective way is to attend events. Attending events will help you meet people and help you develop the idea on selling yourself. Just be open minded, be willing to listen and be ready to share your ideas with other people.
            Event types well known to give networking opportunities - Conferences, Seminars, bla bla bla</p>
            
            <p>2.Education-You can learn pretty much any skill nowadays. But events offer a more interactive environment where people can get to learn new skills that will benefit them in their life, studies, or future career prospects. 
            The importance of schools, online courses and so on cannot be overemphasized, but unfortunately we live in a society where people really do not know that attending events can make education more relatable and valuable to their lives.
            Events types include - Seminars, tour, excursion.</p>
            
            <p>3. Marketing-  Events are a great way to market products and services, you can get to discover new and amazing tools, resources, hacks that might be of help to you.</p>
            
            <p>So many people don't know that attending events like trade shows can boost their products and brands. Attending events that you can showcase your products, boost your sales and network yourself is often what most business owners need. When marketing your products,  it's important to be creative and use a variety of methods to get your message across like using words of the mouth. Some products and services don't get enough recognition and doesn't get acknowledged by others because marketers don't know the right events to attend.
            Events types for businesses struggling to get that crazy and organic growth: Trade Shows, Seminars.</p>
            
            <p> 4. Escapism- A daily routine can be quite exhaustive, boring. Events gives you the opportunity to escape, experience energy giving adventures and explore a little to brighten up yourself.</p>
            
            <p> Escapism allows you to take a break from reality and live in a different world. You can escape from the day-to-day stresses of your life and attend events to let your focus be on something else.
            Events:Music festivals, yoga retreat</p>
            
            <p> 5. Inspiration- Inspiration is found in alot of different places, different things can inspire people like a talented performer killing it on the stage, a speaker saying a quote from a book you've read, or even a coach making you see a better way of doing things. Meeting such a person at your event can create a burning passion that can linger for a long time.</p>
            
            <p>A friend of mine invited me to a music concert. That very day, I was feeling down and all I needed was good music to make me feel good and to clear my head. The event did me good brothers and sisters üíõ
             Events: Speaking engagement, music concerts.</p>
             
           <p> Events also help in making people get recognized and appreciated for the awesome things they're doing. Good news is that you can also get free food/ treats when you attend events (we no talk anything o). So you don't leave there with an empty stomach.</p>
            
           <p> Events are important and we think people should put more energy into attending.‚ô•Ô∏è</p>
